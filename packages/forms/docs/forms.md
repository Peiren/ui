Report on the form lib status
===

Subject: list, find, estimate the missing features, bugs and architecture issues on the form lib react-jsonschema-form.

https://jira.talendforge.org/browse/TFD-1039


Context: the forms are generated by TCOMP + Daikon.
The jsonschema define the data, so we can have only one jsonschema per entity and the UI schema define the forms so we can have multiple uischema per entity.

- Conclusion

our architecture
===

Our architecture is the following.
Schema + UISchema define a form which is send to the client
The client display the form.
If the UIschema define triggers, onChange call the trigger which send the form to the backend which validate the data and send back the new form.

This has an issue: payloads are quite bigs and network latency make the user experience on the form really bad.


fieldsets
===

definition: this is a group of field inside a form.
``
<form>
	<fieldset>
		<input type="text" name="foo" />
		<input type="text" name="bar" />
	</fieldset>
	<fieldset>
		<input type="text" name="ssl" />
	</fieldset>
</form>
``

Needs: We need to be able to build UI schema that define fieldset and redering of fieldset.
The payload must be as in HTML as if fieldset were not in the form.
``
{
	foo: '...',
	bar: '...',
	ssl: '...',
}
``

Fieldset may also be used as a widget for a field of type 'object';

Status:
In the current lib we need to change the jsonschema using an type='object' to group the fields. So we can't do as in HTML.

This change the serialized data sent to the server this is not what we want.

What happens with schemaform lib:
- https://github.com/json-schema-form/json-schema-form/wiki/Documentation#fieldset-and-section
- http://schemaform.io/examples/bootstrap-example.html and select Kitchen Sink

> fieldset and section doesn't need a key. You can create generic groups with them. They do need a list of items to have as children.

So this is the way to go.

validation
===

Status:
The current lib proceed validation using jsonschema one entry point:

'validate' function(formData, errors) // errors['myfield'] || errors.addError('message')

by default validation happens on submit.
We can set liveValidate props at true to validate on every changes.

missing features:
- validate onBlur
- validate async (blocker)

redux-form lib support this in a far better way: http://redux-form.com/6.6.2/examples/asyncValidation/


Question: what is the validation mecanism server side ? May a component developer can create custom validation inside the component definition ?

Answer:

Error display
===

Status: When the form status change to error, a global class is set on the form: 'has-error'.
When the errors comes from only one field, the field has also a class.
Messages are displayed next to the widget

errors are injected throw validation in as a List you can customize using
*transformErrors* function(errors) to customize messages.

Customization: We can customize the ErrorList (global) but not per field
So If we want custom rendering for one field of the errors we can't;

Bug: Error displayed is remove when state.status === 'editing' so on each change.
This make the form flicking a lot

Documentation
===

The documentation of react-jsonschema-form is only a demo page.
For example you can't find any documentation about UISchema that explain the possibilities. No references.

The documentation is considered as poor by all frontend guys. (need to read the source first)

Wizard
===

A wizard is a series of Forms with at the end a final submit with all the needed information.

By design react-jsonschema-form save the state of the form into the Form instance using default react state. So building a wizard means manage the data your self outside of the lib for each submit.

TComp can provide wizards (how ?)
TODO: see what is wizard from TCOMP and if it can be covered.

Widgets
===

All form libs provide the needed widgets + ability to create custom widget.
The only limitation we have with reac-jsonschema-form is the widget doesn't have the all formData. That has been fixed recently in our fork.

So no problem on widgets and customization here.

Event handler
===

We should not in our context need to do event handler except for custom form because of the trigger.
The only event handler we have used at the moment is the onChange to extract the form data into redux so we can play with the form data outside of the form.


Mutliple Submit
====

We can't have multiple submit button on form (because of event handling).
By default HTML let you do that and you can use the triggered event to know the button name so the action to trigger.

This has been implemented using custom actions using the onClick event but without the ability to call the validation process. This is a blocker


Form state
===

valid, invalid, pristine, dirty, touched, untouched, pending

*Only invalid* exists with react-jsonschema-form.
So no way to customize widgets depending on the state or errors.

An example is I can't warn the user if the form is dirty and he is about to loose the form that his data are not saved.


Conclusion
====

(partials until all the things are reviewed)

We already have forked the library.
Because of the recursive approch on the jsonschema to render the form we will not being able to support fieldset / columns / tabs without a big refactoring of the core library and the UI schema structure.

The react-jsonschema-form lib has a good idea but a bad implementation with many design issues;

We are still at early usage and have so many problems that show us we may need to think a bit more about it.

* fieldsets are not supported and can't be fixed without a big refactoring
* multiple submits is not supported (we can find a workaround)
* advanced form state are not supported and need lots of work
* wizard are not supported at the moment
* error display flicks a lot (may be fixed)
* forms update flicks (because of our architecture)
* async validation is not supported and need lots of work
* validation error has not been integrated at the moment
